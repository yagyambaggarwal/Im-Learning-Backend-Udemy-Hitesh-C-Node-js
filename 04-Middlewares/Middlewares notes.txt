Ques How to use middlewares?
Ans 1) eg of middlewares => app.use(express.json), app.use(express.txt)
    2) These middlewares only get into between in the execution only when the routes after they are written are called.
    3) If there are more then 1 middlewares, they always execute in sequece like one after the other in which they are made.
    4) eg of creating a custom middlewares:
    app.use(function (req, res, next){
        console.log("I'm a middleware A");
        next();  # This says "I'm done and please go below (next to) me."
    })
    //Another middleware
    app.use(function (req, res, next){
        console.log("I'm a middleware B");
        return res.json({id : 1, name : "Yagyam"});
    })



Ques Types of middlewares?
Ans They are 
    i Global middlewares -> Will run for each and every route.
    ii Route Specific middlewares -> Will run only for a specified route.

Global middlewares:
    eg:
    app.use(function(req, res, next){
        console.log("This is the Global middlewares.");
        next();
    })

    app.get("/", (req, res)=>{
        res.end("Homepage");
    })

    app.post("/tweet", (req, res)=>{
        res.end("Tweet is created")
    })

Route Specific middlewares:
    eg:
    function middleware1(req, res, next){
        console.log("Route Specific middleware 1.");
        next();
    }
    function middleware2(req, res, next){
        console.log("Route Specific middleware 2.");
        next();
    }

    app.get("/contact-us", middleware1, middleware2, (req, res)=>{
        res.status(200).end("Jo bhi route ke executions hai wo...");
    })
