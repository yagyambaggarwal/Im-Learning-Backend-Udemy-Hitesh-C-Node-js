### Modules Types:

1\. Built-In (eg. file System)

Whats the difference between sync and normal, ie., for eg, readfile and readfilesync; Here the readfilesync is a blocking version that is wait's for the task to complete.

2\. Third Party (npm)

3\. Custom (I can make myself)

### What does git init do?

Well this makes the entire project as package, installs the node modules and makes package.json file.

Further, when we install other packages, they are updated in the package.json and package-lock.json is also maintained accordingly.
